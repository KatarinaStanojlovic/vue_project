Integration of Public API Data: The application leverages public APIs to retrieve data and dynamically display it in blocks on the user interface. These blocks feature relevant images and are equipped with search functionality, enabling users to conveniently explore and find desired items.

User Authentication and Role-Based Access: A significant aspect of the project is the implementation of user authentication and authorization based on role. Users are authenticated using data from the store, and their details are securely stored in LocalStorage. Access to different pages and functionalities is tailored according to the user's role, ensuring a personalized experience.

Custom Two-Way Binding Inputs: The project introduces custom input components that facilitate two-way data binding. These custom inputs enhance the user experience on forms, allowing seamless interaction and data manipulation.

User Registration with Validation: The application includes a user registration feature that incorporates robust validation mechanisms. Input data is carefully validated to ensure accuracy and security. Valid user details are stored in the store, contributing to the creation of a comprehensive user database.

Admin Section for Store Entity Management: The project incorporates an admin section that enables administrators to manage various entities stored within the application's data store. This section empowers administrators to perform tasks such as adding, modifying, or deleting entities, ensuring efficient content management.

User-Centric Pages Highlighting Core Functionality: The application features a minimum of two pages tailored for end-users. These pages serve as a showcase for the core functionality of the online shop, delivering an intuitive and engaging shopping experience. Key features, such as product listings, detailed product views, and user interactions, are prominently displayed.

Conclusion: This project serves as a comprehensive illustration of modern web development practices utilizing Vue.js. With its emphasis on role-based access, modular template structure, API integration, and a user-friendly interface, the project delivers a robust e-commerce application that adheres to industry standards and enhances the educational journey of second-year students.
